# Week 3

Yesterday we were introduced to the making of Agar (agar-agar), a jelly like substance obtained from Algae. In Asia it is widely used as a gelatine for deserts but in microbiology it is used as a compound of a medium to grow bacteria on.

We used a powder pre-fabricated medium and we tried to use household ingredients to create our own. We boiled the solutions for 20 minutes in 121 degrees. See the image below for the results: the pre-fabricated medium is very even and transparant, the 'home-made' version is non-transparant and lumpy (thanks to the - 46! - beer yeast tablets that turned out to have more fat than yeast in them!).
